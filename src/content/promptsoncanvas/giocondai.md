Generate the portrait of a woman in the style of Renaissance madonnas. The woman sits three-quarters in a collected posture, has a serene expression that captures the viewer as if she were really looking at him. The shaded tone around the corners of her eyes and mouth creates an ambiguous expression. In the background we see in detail an imaginary landscape inspired by 16th century Tuscany, with a valley surrounded by mountains and a river flowing in the center.
