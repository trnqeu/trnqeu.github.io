\> An all-night diner in a city at night, with three customers sitting at the counter and a fourth person, possibly the server, standing behind the counter. The diner is brightly lit, and the exterior is mostly dark, with a few buildings visible in the background. The scene has a sense of loneliness and isolation, as the figures are all alone and seem lost in their own thoughts.
